    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) **Learning Rate:** the rate at which the system modifies its paramteres based on the given data.\n",
    "#### 2) **Fitness (Utility) Function:** a function that measures how good a model is.\n",
    "#### 3) **Cost Function:** a function that measures how bad a model is.\n",
    "#### 4) **Regularization:** constraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "#### 5) **Generalization Error:** error rate on the new test cases (testing data).\n",
    "#### 6) **Holdout Validation:** hold out part of the training set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one.\n",
    "#### 7) **No Free Lunch (NFL) Theorem:** if there are no assumptions about the data, there is no reason to prefer a model over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Supervised Learning\n",
    "The training data contains labels, which show the desired outputs; for instance, classification and predictors.\n",
    "#### Algorithms\n",
    "• k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "• Linear Regression\n",
    "• Logistic Regression\n",
    "• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "• Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "• Neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "The training data is unlabeled so that the system learns without a teacher; for example, Anomaly detection, Novelty detection, and Association rule learning.\n",
    "#### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "• Clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Anomaly detection and novelty detection: One-class SVM， Isolation Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "• Visualization and dimensionality reduction：Principal Component Analysis (PCA)，Kernel PCA， Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)， t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Association rule learning：Apriori，Eclat\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "The training data is partially labeled and mostly unlabeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "The learning system, AKA `agent`, observes the environment, selects and perfoms actions, and gets rewarded/punished in order to find the best strategy, AKA `policy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Batch Learning\n",
    "The system does NOT learn incremently and should be trained with all the available data beforehand. Each addition of data would require training using the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Online Learning\n",
    "The system learn incrementally as the data is introduced sequentially to the system. However, the system become vulnerable to corrupt data inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data challenges:\n",
    "#### 1) Insufficient training data\n",
    "#### 2) Nonrepresentative training data\n",
    "#### 3) Poor-quality data\n",
    "#### 4) Irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm challenges:\n",
    "#### 1) Overfitting the training data: overgeneralize the results.\n",
    "#### 2) Underfitting the training data: use a really simple model.\n"
